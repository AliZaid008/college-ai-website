            <p>The admission average is determined annually by the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research, and it depends on the college's capacity and the general averages of applicants. According to the latest results for special admissions for the academic year 2020-2021, the minimum admission average for the College of Artificial Intelligence at the University of Baghdad was 62.62%. This means that a student must obtain an average close to this percentage to be admitted to one of the college's departments, noting that the college's admission system is a special admissions process.</p>
